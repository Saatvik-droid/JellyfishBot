# JellyfishBot
Jelllyfish discord game bot made in discord.py

Was a commision kinda thing for a spongebob server. Didnt really go live for a long time.

Basically sends a jelly image from the images directory and listens for a command to catch the jelly. 
You can be stung instead and all that shit.

'==help' in a discord channel should give you all user commands if you ever run it.

*Not going to look at issues or bugs*
