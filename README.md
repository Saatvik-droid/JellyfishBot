# JellyfishBot
Jelllyfish discord game bot made in discord.py

Was a commision kinda thing for a spongebob server. Didnt really go live for a long time.

Basically sends a jelly image from the images directory and listens for a command to catch the jelly. 
You can be stung instead and all that shit.
