# JellyfishBot
Jelllyfish discord game bot made in discord.py

Was a commision kinda thing for a spongebob server. Never went live.

Basically sends a jelly image from the images directory and listens for a command to catch the jelly. 
You can be stung instead and all that shit.

*Not going to look at issues or bugs*
